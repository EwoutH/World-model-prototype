# Investment Decisions

This subcategory focuses on the modeling of investment decisions in economic agent-based models. It includes two main behaviors:

1. **Risk-Taking Propensity (`risk_taking_propensity.py`)**
   - This behavior models different levels of risk tolerance among investors. It is based on theories of risk preferences in financial decision-making. The script simulates how investors with varying risk tolerances make investment choices.

2. **Market Influence Response (`market_influence_response.py`)**
   - This script simulates how investors adjust their investment strategies in response to market data and trends. It draws on behavioral finance theories that suggest investor decisions are influenced by psychological factors and market movements.

Each script is accompanied by documentation detailing the underlying theories and unit tests to ensure the functionality of the behaviors.

## Usage
To use these behaviors in your agent-based models, import the desired script and instantiate the provided classes with the required parameters. The documentation within each script provides further guidance on their implementation and testing.
